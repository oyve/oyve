I'm a developer at heart! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3Ii2SW00oLZ8k/giphy.gif" width="25px" /> <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/OsxEuns6kqXIY/giphy.gif" width="25px" />

My student room - Trondheim, Norway, 2001.

#### So how did it all start?

Well, you see that book above? The Javascript one. I can't remember the year I got it, but it was sometime after '94 when I started learning HTML + JavaScript on my dads computer, a Victor i486 33Mhz with a 28.8 bps dial-up connection that was shared with our house phone line.

Little did I know, at that time, I would have a career in software and build large applications several years later. For most part it was teenage fun and a big (very big) rabbit hole to explore (I haven't seen the end of it yet...).

Unfortunately, I don't have a photo or screenshot of my first web page, but it's quite easy to describe:
* It had two Clip Art palm trees, one on the left and one on the right (back when HTML tables were advanced web design)
* Some text in the middle (probably my name, that I liked rollerblades and punk music, like Offspring and Millencolin)
* Later I would add a counter as I learned about JavaScript and cookies
* I would also learn Paintshop Pro and Photoshop to make beveled graphics with gradients and shadows - a skill any web-developer with respect for themself would learn back in the days.

#### Anyways, here's a reproduction of my first website anno 1995:

Back then, everyone were doing backend, frontend and design at the same time. Luckily things have changed or we might still have had Clip Art palm trees around!
